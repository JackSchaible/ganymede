    <p>DM Tools Encounters allow you to efficienctly orchestrate combat encounters. Create your monsters then add them
      to
      an encounter. Give your encounter a name, XP value, and more. You can auto-roll initiative for all your monsters.
      You can even save common monsters for use in other encounters. Organize your encounters into an
      infinitely-nestible
      grouping system, too!</p>
